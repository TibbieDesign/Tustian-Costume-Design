                    A good costume can bring an actor confidence, and inform their performance choices. 
                    By incorporating pieces that impact body movement, you can help the actor physically inhabit their role.<br><br>
                    You must be able to work as part of a team to bring the vision of the director to life. 
                    Your costumes must work well with the set design and the lighting design. I have been very lucky to work with some 
                    incredibly talented directors, actors, set, lighting, hair, and make-up designers. It is truly a joy when it all comes together to create theater magic.</p>
